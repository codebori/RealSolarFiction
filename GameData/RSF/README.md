https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196996-real-world-sci-fi-mod-collection/

The goal is to create a real world semi realistic sci-fi mod collection with the focus on (but not limited to) achieving off world self sufficient bases.

It will probably be in the form of a "mod" (Real Solar Fiction) containing patches to glue everything together, based on my old project SpaceBoriâ€™s resource patches.

I am not a developer, nor a graphic designer and I don't want to do work that has already been done. So the project should not be so realistic that it becomes too complex.

For now we'll have 2 forks. One depending on Real Fuels and the other on Rational Resources. Both combinations will need to be tested and everything can still change.

We are starting with RSF+RF:
```diff

! Needs some patches 
- Incompatible

Incompatible:

All:
- Crew R&R -> Overlaps with LRTR RP-1 functionality.
- Realism Overhaul -> Incompatible with/same functionality as LRTR.
- TAC-LS and Remote Tech -> Incompatible with/same functionality as Kerbalism.
- Hide Empty Tech Tree Nodes -> Incompatible with LRTR RP-1 functionality.
- Procedural Fairings for Everything -> Seems to be incompatible with most mods, in this case it seems to mess up the Tech Tree.
- Advanced Jet Engine -> Old, broken and seemingly no longer maintained.
RF:
- Mark IV Spaceplane System -> Incompatible with RF while OPT provides similar compatible parts so it is not worth the effort to write patches for Mark IV.
```

I don't want to do this alone and just for myself. So who's interested in playing (more or less) realistic career sci-fi KSP? And who wants to help put this together?

## Known Issues:

- [] "DMagic Orbital Science" is incompatible with LRTR's Kerbalism Config  
- [] "OhScrap!" overlaps with Kerbalism functionality
- [] SXT LV-405 Vanguard still has Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer for its additional RCS engine 
- [] "Restock" Oscar B tank volumes are inconsistent with the stock one
- [] Procedural Part Tanks are to big at the start and too small later on
- [] TantaresSP Zircon RCS Series require Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer 
- [] Some Tantares engines have very high ISP  
 
## To Do
 
- [] Write installation instructions: 
	- [] Dependencies: 
		- [] Kerbalism -> Kerbalism LRTR Config
	- [] Configuration:
		- [] Turn off Real Fuels or Kerbalism ignition limit
- [] Make "DMagic Orbital Science" compatible with LRTR's Kerbalism Config  
- [] Suggest more configuration options for "OhScrap!" to turn of some functionality
- [] Move Airplane parts (Stock and from mods) around in the Tech Tree (mainly earlier)
- [] [SXT LV-405 Vanguard](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/SXTContinued/blob/master/GameData/SXT/Parts/Rocketry/Engine/Vanguard/X405.cfg) still has Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer for its additional RCS engine -> write patch and submit it to RealFuels-Stock 
- [] Fix Oscar B tank volumes: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196996-real-world-sci-fi-mod-collection/&do=findComment&comment=3862324
- [] Make sure there are ullage motors available early in the tech tree
- [] Remove the Size restrictions from PP tanks, leave only the volume related upgrade path
- [] Fix TantaresSP Zircon RCS Series require Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer and submit it to RealFuels-Stock
- [] Check Tantares engines ISP
